Stuff we found useful for our kids (and pregnancy/parenting)

Planning to get pregant:
1. Start taking prenatals

Pregnancy:
1. Get the Expecting Better book
2. Sign up for a pregancy workout ()
3. Make a registry for the baby on Amazon. Even if you don't share it, Amazon will give you a 10% coupon for items in the registry, but they only give it to you after some time ~30 days after you make the registry or something like that.

Pregnancy complications:
1. Gestational Diabetes

Newborn:
1. Diapers (subscribe and save on Amazon with at least 4 other items will give you a 20% discount. This, we found, was the best combination of convenience and price). We prefer Huggies.
1. Baby wipes
2. Bouncy ball, these are indespensible to calm a crying baby. They are also great for dealing with contractions
3. Sound machine
3. Bath tub
    ladle
    hooded towel
    Shampoo, moisturizers, vaseline (aquaphor), cerave skin cream 
1. breast pump (ACA vs fancy) milk storage bags
1. bottle, nipples (introduce at 1month) if you intend for the baby to be bottle friendly
1. blackout curtains


baby monitor

Medicine:
1. Childrens tylenol, for e.g. when they are teething. Though we subscribe to the belief that fever reducers actually make things worse (see Dr Offit)
1. Vitamin D drops
1. Desitin
1. Lotion

1. [Sleep sack](https://woolino.com/collections/baby-sleeping-bags)
1. Burp cloths
1. Cloths for changing table
1. swaddles (0-~2mos), and a [velcro](https://www.amazon.com/Halo-Sleepsack-Swaddle-Wearable-Blanket/dp/B076HNK6QX) one after ~2 mos 
5. Furniture:
    1. [Crib](https://www.amazon.com/Babyletto-Hudson-Convertible-Toddler-Conversion/dp/B007CRJHUI) or bassinet (really, get a full size crib - bassinets are a waste of time, we think), sheets, [mattress](https://www.amazon.com/Newton-Breathable-Suffocation-Hypoallergenic-Non-Toxic/dp/B00WR958TA)
    2. Changing table, changing [pad](https://www.buybuybaby.com/store/product/keekaroo-peanut-changer/3272011?brandId=775)
    3. Dresser (we have a babyletto matching to the crib, but probably worth getting something a bit more generic so it lasts longer/after child is older)
    mirror you can place on the floor
    4. rocking chair for feeding

strollers..
This is a very tricky topic, it seems that there are a million stollers out there and noone can find the one that fits them perfectly.
It is important for the baby to lay flat (vs seated) for the first at least 4 months, but really 6 months.
For that reason, look for a stroller that can support a bassinet. Often times the bassinet can be found dirt cheap and barely used on craigslit since most people in America are not into them. Alternatively, some stroller can lie flat, those are acceptable instead of a bassinet.
We had a nuna mixx and generally liked it. What we did LOVE from nuna was their carseat, nuna pipa lite - it's amazingly light. BUT... You can't take into a cab.
