# Stuff we found useful for our kids (and pregnancy/parenting)

## Planning to get pregant TBD:
* Start taking prenatals

## Pregnancy TBD:
* Make a registry for the baby on Amazon. Even if you don't share it, Amazon will give you a 10% coupon for items in the registry, but they only give it to you after some time ~30 days after you make the registry or something like that.
* Get the Expecting Better book
* Sign up for a pregancy workout ()

## Packing a hospital bag
* Outfit for the baby to go home in
* Maybe nail clippers for the baby - they come out with quite the nails
* Phone chargers (label them with your name)
* Wetwipes for mom (much more pleasant and easier to use than toilet paper when you need to go)
* Swim trunks for dad and flipflops for mom & dad
* Change of clothes for mom & dad
* Car seat (see below)

## Postpartum (but make/buy ahead of time)
* Make [padsicles](https://www.healthline.com/health/pregnancy/padsicles#how-to-make) and freeze them
* 

## Newborn:
1. Diapers (subscribe and save on Amazon with at least 4 other items will give you a 20% discount. This, we found, was the best combination of convenience and price). We prefer Huggies.
1. [Baby wipes](https://www.amazon.com/WaterWipes-Sensitive-Wipes-Count-Packs/dp/B008KJEYLO), another subscribe and save candidate. We tried a bunch and this brand seems to be by far the best option.
1. [Yoga ball](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B072MJSB38), these are indespensible to calm a crying baby. They are also great for dealing with contractions. 65" is the one we have
1. Sound machine

1. Bath [tub](https://www.amazon.com/First-Years-Comfort-Newborn-Toddler/dp/B000XW65SG) you want to use the mesh hammock thing for the first ~3 months. Then just bath the baby in shallow water in a big tub - that's better for their back. Don't wash the baby till the umbilical cord falls off and heals, ~2-3 weeks.
    ladle
    hooded towel
    Shampoo, moisturizers, vaseline (aquaphor), [cerave](https://www.amazon.com/CeraVe-Moisturizing-Cream-Daily-Moisturizer/dp/B00TTD9BRC) lotion vs desitin
1. breast pump (ACA vs fancy) milk storage bags. ACA will provide you with a breastpump. However, it is pretty bare bones. If you decide you will pump often (depends on work schedule, etc.) consider [Spectra S1](https://www.amazon.com/Spectra-Baby-USA-Rechargeable-Electric/dp/B00DBKFFJM), it's excellent.
You will also need storage bags if you pump, we found [Lansinoh](https://www.amazon.com/Lansinoh-Breastmilk-Breastfeeding-Directly-Essentials/dp/B006XISCNA) to be most convenient (they store flat vs other brands that don't)
1. bottle, nipples (introduce at 1month) if you intend for the baby to be bottle friendly. [Dr Brown](https://www.amazon.com/Dr-Browns-Options-Bottle-4-Pack/dp/B01845QH7M) bottles were by far our favorite.
We haven't found a bottle warmer that we like, so we just use our sous-vide immersion circulator - works fabulously and you can also use it to cook meat!
1. Blackout curtains - really helps the baby/toddler sleep (at lest we think so). Obviously numerous options there, we have outfitted the whole house with ones from [SelectBlinds](https://www.selectblinds.com/cellular-shades/select-blackout-cellulars.html
)


Baby monitor, this [Infant Optics](https://www.amazon.com/Infant-Optics-DXR-8-Monitor-Interchangeable/dp/B00ECHYTBI) model is probably very dated, but we like it 

## Medicine, etc.
1. [Vitamin D drops](https://www.amazon.com/Ddrops-Vitamin-drops-2-5mL-fl-oz/dp/B003CT36NE). Breastfed babies need vitamin D because breastmilk doesn't contain any. 
1. Desitin - this creates a physical barrier between your baby's skin an whatever else (e.g. poop in the diaper) This is indispensible for babies with very sensitive skin. We, luckily, haven't had a great need for it.
1. Lotion - unlike Desitin, this just moisturizes. Most babies/kids have skin problems (Eczema) and daily (after shower) moisturization is the cure. It also works on scuffs and scrapes to make 'em heal a bit faster. [CeraVe](https://www.amazon.com/CeraVe-Moisturizing-Cream-Daily-Moisturizer/dp/B00TTD9BRC) is our dermotologist friends' recommendation and our preference - the tub is easy to use (vs squeeze bottle), it absorbs super fast, and is fragrance free.
1. Childrens tylenol, for e.g. when they are teething. Though we subscribe to the belief that fever reducers actually make things worse and have opted not to give tylenol unless absolutely necessary (see [Overkill](https://www.amazon.com/Overkill-When-Modern-Medicine-Goes-ebook/dp/B07V6BK7XG))

1. [Sleep sack](https://woolino.com/collections/baby-sleeping-bags)
1. Burp cloths
1. Cloths for changing table
1. swaddles (0-~2mos), and a [velcro](https://www.amazon.com/Halo-Sleepsack-Swaddle-Wearable-Blanket/dp/B076HNK6QX) one after ~2 mos 
5. Furniture:
    1. [Crib](https://www.amazon.com/Babyletto-Hudson-Convertible-Toddler-Conversion/dp/B007CRJHUI) or bassinet (really, get a full size crib - bassinets are a waste of time, we think), sheets, [mattress](https://www.amazon.com/Newton-Breathable-Suffocation-Hypoallergenic-Non-Toxic/dp/B00WR958TA)
    2. Changing table, changing [pad](https://www.buybuybaby.com/store/product/keekaroo-peanut-changer/3272011?brandId=775)
    3. Dresser (we have a babyletto matching to the crib, but probably worth getting something a bit more generic so it lasts longer/after child is older)
    mirror you can place on the floor
    4. rocking chair for feeding

## Stroller & Car seat
FYI: The hospital will likely not let you leave unless you have carseat that is properly installed

This is a very personal topic, it seems that there are a million stollers out there and noone can find the one that fits them perfectly.
It is important for the baby to lay flat (vs seated) for the first [at least] 4 months, but really 6 months.
For that reason, look for a stroller that can support a bassinet or lie completely flat. Often times, the bassinet can be found dirt cheap and barely used on craigslit since most people in America are not into them. Alternatively, some stroller can lie flat, those are acceptable instead of a bassinet.
We had a Nuna Mixx and generally liked it. What we did LOVE from Nuna was their carseat, Nuna Pipa Lite - it's amazingly light - which is a pretty big deal if you go up the stairs, etc. The one drawback of this light design is that you can't take in a cab (or airplane) because it can't attach to a seatbelt without its base.

## clothes
Not going to recomend specific clothes, but here are some brands that we like:
* [Tea collection](https://www.teacollection.com/) makes great stuff but it's expensive. Nordstrom Rack/Hautelook and Tea website often has sales that make the clothes reasonably priced.
* [Primary](https://www.primary.com/) makes makes great basics like pajamas, undies. They fit tight for safety, but older kids may not love this
* [Cat and Jack](https://www.target.com/b/cat-jack/-/N-qqqgm) is a target brand that has some great options at very affordable prices
