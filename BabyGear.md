# Stuff we found useful for our kids (and pregnancy/parenting)

## Planning to get pregant TBD:
* Start taking prenatals

## Pregnancy TBD:
* Make a registry for the baby on Amazon. Even if you don't share it, Amazon will give you a 10% coupon for items in the registry, but they only give it to you after some time ~30 days after you make the registry or something like that.
* Get the Expecting Better book
* Sign up for a pregancy workout ()

## Packing a hospital bag
* Outfit for the baby to go home in
* Maybe nail clippers for the baby - they come out with quite the nails
* Phone chargers (label them with your name)
* Wetwipes for mom (much more pleasant and easier to use than toilet paper when you need to go)
* Swim trunks for dad and flipflops for mom & dad
* Change of clothes for mom & dad
* Car seat (see below)

## Postpartum (but make/buy ahead of time)
* Make [padsicles](https://www.healthline.com/health/pregnancy/padsicles#how-to-make) and freeze them
* 

## Newborn:
1. Diapers (subscribe and save on Amazon with at least 4 other items will give you a 20% discount. This, we found, was the best combination of convenience and price). We prefer Huggies. (you will go through ~8-12 diapers in a 24 hour period)

1. [Baby wipes](https://www.amazon.com/WaterWipes-Sensitive-Wipes-Count-Packs/dp/B008KJEYLO), another subscribe and save candidate. We tried a bunch and this brand seems to be by far the best option.

1. [Yoga ball](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B072MJSB38), these are indespensible to calm a crying baby or rock it to sleep. They are also great for dealing with contractions; 65" is the one we have

1. [Sound machine](https://www.amazon.com/Portable-Relaxing-Soothing-Charging-Auto-Off/dp/B00A2JBMRE), this helps babies and toddlers fall asleep and not be distracted by other noises.

1. Baby monitor, this [Infant Optics](https://www.amazon.com/Infant-Optics-DXR-8-Monitor-Interchangeable/dp/B00ECHYTBI) model is probably very dated, but we like it.

1. Nail clippers, we found nail clippers work better than nail scissors, but try both and see which you prefer. The nail polishing things are a waste of time.

1. [Absorbent pad](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07F2QFRT5) these are great to put on the changing pad, be able to put baby on the floor nakie, or put on a bed when your toddler stops wearing diapers at night - good investment!

1. Diaper bag. There are purpose built diaper bags and they are great if you travel or do lots of "moving around". But a better bet for people that mostly go for walks, travel occasionally is something you can reporpose, like a canvas bag.


### Bath time
1. Bath [tub](https://www.amazon.com/First-Years-Comfort-Newborn-Toddler/dp/B000XW65SG) you will want to use the mesh hammock for the first ~3 months. Then just bathe the baby in shallow water in a big tub - that's better for their backs. Don't wash the baby till the umbilical cord falls off and heals, ~2-3 weeks.

1. Something to rinse baby with, e.g. [this](https://www.amazon.com/Skip-Hop-Tear-Free-Waterfall-Rinser/dp/B00FXR5S20)

1. Hooded towels are very nice

1. [Shampoo](https://www.amazon.com/Cetaphil-Baby-Shampoo-Organic-Calendula/dp/B07VHR8NDF) though you will probably want to do water only for first ~3 weeks, avoiding the belly button area.

1. Vaseline (aquaphor) great on super dry skin, bumps, and bruises

1. [Moisturizer, cerave](https://www.amazon.com/CeraVe-Moisturizing-Cream-Daily-Moisturizer/dp/B00TTD9BRC)

### Pumping/bottle feeding
1. Breast pump. ACA will provide you with a breastpump. However, it is pretty bare bones. If you decide you will pump often (depends on work schedule, etc.) consider [Spectra S1](https://www.amazon.com/Spectra-Baby-USA-Rechargeable-Electric/dp/B00DBKFFJM), it's excellent.

1. [Breast pads](https://www.amazon.com/Washable-Organic-Contoured-Reusable-Breastfeeding/dp/B01FY8VUKQ) some women need them and some don't, but FYI they exist.

1. You will also need storage bags if you pump, we found [Lansinoh](https://www.amazon.com/Lansinoh-Breastmilk-Breastfeeding-Directly-Essentials/dp/B006XISCNA) to be most convenient (they store flat vs other brands that don't)

1. Bottle, nipples. If you intend for the baby to be bottle friendly consider introducing the baby to bottle once per day at 1mo of age, otherwise might be harder later. [Dr Brown](https://www.amazon.com/Dr-Browns-Options-Bottle-4-Pack/dp/B01845QH7M) bottles were by far our favorite.

1. Bottle warmer... We haven't found a bottle warmer that we like, so we just use our sous-vide immersion circulator - works fabulously and you can also use it to cook meat!

1. If you use bottles/pump, you will need to sterilize it... [Bottle sterilizer](https://www.amazon.com/Philips-AVENT-Microwave-Steam-Sterilizer/dp/B007VBXKG2) is simple, cheap, and effective

1. [Bottle drying rack](https://www.amazon.com/Boon-Grass-Countertop-Drying-Green/dp/B0032G9E0G) to dry bottles, etc



## Medicine, etc.
1. [Vitamin D drops](https://www.amazon.com/Ddrops-Vitamin-drops-2-5mL-fl-oz/dp/B003CT36NE). Breastfed babies need vitamin D because breastmilk doesn't contain any. 
1. Desitin - this creates a physical barrier between your baby's skin and whatever else (e.g. poop in the diaper.) This is indispensible for babies with very sensitive skin. We, luckily, haven't had a great need for it.
1. Lotion - unlike Desitin, this just moisturizes. Most babies/kids have skin problems (Eczema) and daily (after shower) moisturization is the cure. It also works on scuffs and scrapes to make 'em heal a bit faster. [CeraVe](https://www.amazon.com/CeraVe-Moisturizing-Cream-Daily-Moisturizer/dp/B00TTD9BRC) is our dermotologist friends' recommendation and our preference - the tub is easy to use (vs squeeze bottle), it absorbs super fast, and is fragrance free.
1. Childrens tylenol, for e.g. when they are teething or catch a cold. Though we subscribe to the belief that fever reducers actually make things worse and have opted not to give tylenol unless absolutely necessary it's good to have on hand (see [Overkill](https://www.amazon.com/Overkill-When-Modern-Medicine-Goes-ebook/dp/B07V6BK7XG))
1. Sunscreen, no sun screen for babies under 6 months. After that, use a mineral one. We found this [thinksport](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007SAC6XE) to be the easiest to apply but it does have a scent. Other options we like are [mustela](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0822M17DK) and [blue lizard](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01M67WKPZ) is neat because the bottle/cap change color outside and it's a good aide to teach kids they need sunscreen

## Clothes, et.al.
1. Swaddles (0-~2mos), and a [velcro](https://www.amazon.com/Halo-Sleepsack-Swaddle-Wearable-Blanket/dp/B076HNK6QX) one after ~1-2 mos - makes swaddling much faster and easier.

1. [Sleep sack](https://woolino.com/collections/baby-sleeping-bags) at ~3 mos you will want to teach the baby to not need a swaddle. These sleepsacks are great for that and they come in various thicknesses to match your weather (we used these till ~18mos since you shouldn't use a blanket or put anything else in the crib)

1. Burp cloths

1. Cloths for changing table

Not going to recomend specific clothes, but here are some brands that we like:
* [Tea collection](https://www.teacollection.com/) makes great stuff but it's expensive. Nordstrom Rack/Hautelook and Tea website often has sales that make the clothes reasonably priced.
* [Primary](https://www.primary.com/) makes makes great basics like pajamas, undies. They fit tight for safety, but older kids may not love this
* [Cat and Jack](https://www.target.com/b/cat-jack/-/N-qqqgm) is a target brand that has some great options at very affordable prices
* [Kate Quinn Organics](https://katequinn.com/) make cute clothes for girls
* [Ten Little](https://tenlittle.com/) Make expensive but very durable and high quality shoes, their socks are great too (this is for older 1+yr olds)

## Stroller & Car seat
FYI: The hospital will likely not let you leave unless you have carseat that is properly installed

This is a very personal topic, it seems that there are a million stollers out there and noone can find the one that fits them perfectly.
It is important for the baby to lay flat (vs seated) for the first [at least] 4 months, but really 6 months.
For that reason, look for a stroller that can support a bassinet or lie completely flat. Often times, the bassinet can be found dirt cheap and barely used on craigslit since most people in America are not into them. Alternatively, some stroller can lie flat, those are acceptable instead of a bassinet.
We had a Nuna Mixx and generally liked it. What we did LOVE from Nuna was their carseat, Nuna Pipa Lite - it's amazingly light - which is a pretty big deal if you go up the stairs, etc. The one drawback of this light design is that you can't take in a cab (or airplane) because it can't attach to a seatbelt without its base.

## Furniture:
1. [Crib](https://www.amazon.com/Babyletto-Hudson-Convertible-Toddler-Conversion/dp/B007CRJHUI) or bassinet (really, get a full size crib - bassinets are a waste of time, we think), sheets, [mattress](https://www.amazon.com/Newton-Breathable-Suffocation-Hypoallergenic-Non-Toxic/dp/B00WR958TA)

1. Changing table, changing [pad](https://www.buybuybaby.com/store/product/keekaroo-peanut-changer/3272011?brandId=775), you can use a dresser for this as well.

1. Dresser (we have a babyletto matching the crib, but probably worth getting something a bit more generic so it lasts longer/after child is older)

1. Mirror you can place on the floor when the baby is doing tummy time

1. [Rocking chair](https://montedesign.com/products/grano-glider-recliner) for feeding and calming the baby, etc. This is single most expensive piece of furniture we have bought to date. But it's used ~6x per day and well worth it. For those in SF/Bay Area, check out [Aldea](https://aldeahome.com/) they have these in stock and in general have tons of other great baby stuff and advice!

1. Blackout curtains - really helps the baby/toddler sleep (at lest we think so). Obviously numerous options there, we have outfitted the whole house with ones from [SelectBlinds](https://www.selectblinds.com/cellular-shades/select-blackout-cellulars.html
)



## Toys
1. Black and white contrast books - babies don't see well, so they really lke contrast books

1. [These links](https://www.amazon.com/Bright-Starts-Lots-of-Links/dp/B001ABZGU2) are useful to mount toys in stroller and cars, etc. Older (1+yr olds also like playing with them)

1. All babies seem to love [Sophie](https://www.amazon.com/Sophie-Girafe-Gift-set-Award/dp/B008FY37NU)

1. More, TBD

## Random advice (to be categorized)
* At 2 months, move your kiddo to separate room, she and you will both sleep better!

* After about a week or two, if your milk is established (if youre breastfeeding) we stopped waking the baby to feed, especially at night.

* Do lots of tummy time.

* Massage (details later, or ask us)

* Baby needs to sleep ~16hrs, if they are sleeping less they are probably sleep deprived and it makes it harder to put them to sleep.

* Get a baby tracking app [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/baby-tracker-newborn-log/id779656557)/[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nighp.babytracker_android&hl=en&gl=US). We really like this app, they have a watch companion app too. You can pay for it on one account and then connect another/partner account in a free tier. This is super helpful to remember when when to put kiddo to sleep, track how much they sleep, track how much they pee/poop (which is your first sign that something might be wrong)

* There are a bunch of apps to share photos with relatives (like tiny beans) but we prefer to just use a Google shared album - easier and more flexible.

* We also found Wonder Weeks app [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/the-wonder-weeks/id529815782)/[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.twisevictory.apps&hl=en&gl=us) to be useful in understanding why the baby is fussy, what development stage they are going through. They have a book as well, which I don't think adds much value above the app.
